You are a business analyst at Egger Consulting. You have been given this case description from a potential client:

Happy Hat, a U.S. national chain of frozen yogurt stores with about 500 stores in 40 states is asking for assistance with its business processes.
The average number of visitors per store has held constant over the past several years, but revenues per store are down by an average of 10%, and 
many stores are no longer profitable.  The client suspects that a large amount of inventory is being thrown away unused at the end of each day. 
At the same time, customer polling suggests that the yogurt flavor customers want is often not available, even when the flavor is posted on the menu. 
People also complain about stores being closed when they visit. Now, the chain is facing increased competition from frozen yogurt sold in 24-hour grocery stores. 
Happy Hat has asked your team to recommend business process changes that can help them increase revenues and restore profitability.

Happy Hat currently has the following data available: 

4 years of cash register data for every store that has, for each transaction, the date and time of the purchase, the specific items purchased, 
and the sales price of each item purchased.

4 years of delivery data that lists how much of each kind of yogurt mix, flavoring, and topping was delivered to each store each week.

Typical public company accounting data, including annual revenues, annual cost of goods sold, in-store inventory on hand at the end of the year.

 
No other company data is available. 

As a business analyst at Egger Consulting,  you will need to identify one business metric that could be extracted from the available data in the Happy Hat 
case study in order to suggest a business process change that could be related to improving Happy Hatâ€™s revenue or store profitability. 

Remember, an effective metric is one that is directly related to the business process being examined. As such, the metric can be used to help identify a business 
problem to be addressed with a business process change, and later can also help determine if the implemented change was successful 
(through seeing if the changes in the metric are in the direction you would expect after implementing the business process change).



Question 1: Identify a business metric based on the case study.

Days Inventory

Question 2: For the identified metric, state whether it is a revenue, profitability or risk metric.

Profitability Metric

Question 3: Identify the metric as traditional or dynamic. Explain why you classified the metric as you did.

Days inventory is a dynamic metric. This is because the amount of time a product is stored between delivery and selling can be adjusted and changed in the span of less than a month.

Question 4: Which of the data available in the case study would be used to derive the metric you have chosen?

To derive days inventory, we can use the time of purchase and item purchased data from the register.
We also use the delivery data which includes the amount of each ingredient delivered each week.
So the data we use includes:
- 4 years of cash register data for every store that has, for each transaction, the date and time of the purchase, the specific items purchased, and the sales price of each item purchased.
 - 4 years of delivery data that lists how much of each kind of yogurt mix, flavouring, and topping was delivered to each store each week.

Question 5:  Propose a type of relevant business process change that would be supported by the metric you have chosen. Explain why and how your chosen metric relates to your recommended business process change.

A recommended business process change would be to use inventory management in order to optimize days inventory. This would benefit the store as days inventory would be minimized while there is minimal risk of having zero inventory that could be sold. The days inventory metric shows how long the yogurt ingredients are sitting on the shelf while not being sold. Minimizng this metric would reduce the amount of inventory being thrown out, thus increasing profitability.
